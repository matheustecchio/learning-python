# Learning Python

This repository is about my learning in Python.

## 💻 Requirements

The following requirements must be met:

1. Install `Python 3`.
2. Install a **Visual Studio Code**(recommended) or **Spyder IDE** or a Python IDE that has integration with Jupyter Notebooks.

## 💾 Installation

To install, please follow these instructions:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/matheustecchio/learning-python.git
```

## 🖱 How to use

1. After, open the .py file with IDE(must be integrated with Jupyter).
2. Run each Notebook Cell separately. The Cell is separated with `#%%`

NOTE: if you want run with Jupyter, you need to convert the .py file to .ipynb, with a Notebook Converter and run it.
